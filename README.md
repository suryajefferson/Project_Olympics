# Abstract

This project visualizes data from the 2024 Olympics using Power BI, combining datasets from Kaggle [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/paris-2024-olympic-summer-games). It features interactive dashboards with a global medal tally, athlete stats, event stats etc. With 24 custom measures, the project delivers insights into country performance, athlete participation, and event outcomes, providing a clear, dynamic view of Olympic trends.

# Tools I Used

- **Excel**: For initial data cleaning and exploration.
- **Power BI**: To model data, create visualizations, and build interactive dashboards.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and project collaboration.

# Conclusion

Throughout this project on the 2024 Olympics, I gained valuable insights into data analysis and visualization using tools like Power BI and Excel. Working with diverse datasets from Kaggle, I learned how to effectively link multiple tables, create meaningful measures, and present complex information in an engaging way. This experience has sharpened my skills in data manipulation and enhanced my ability to tell stories through data.

Exploring the Olympic insights revealed fascinating trends, such as the impressive performances of countries like the USA and China, and the efficiency rankings that highlight how smaller nations can excel. The stories of individual athletes, like *Zhang Yufei* and *Arisa Trew*, added a personal touch to the statistics, making the data come alive.

Overall, this project not only boosted my technical skills but also sparked my interest in data storytelling. I look forward to applying what I've learned to future projects, blending creativity with analysis to create compelling narratives from data.
